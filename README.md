# Talk to God 
God responses depending on several independent and dependent random variables based on the Holy Bible.

## The core concept

Head moved left times C equal to the number of runs between the randomized appearece of word W = B + n, n being an independent random variable, and B being the base word respective to the start of the word array (W`), the next-word likelyhood averag entropy in the word array ΔS being equal to the individual word-apperence likelihood ΔD (ΔS = ΔD). However n must be generated independently of ΔS, however any pesudo-randomiziation preceedure may be used.

## Limitation 
It is quite slow and inefficient
